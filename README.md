# Data Output

This repository contains an assembly language program for an AVR microcontroller. The program is designed to output data to Port A. Below is a summary of the code:

## Summary

The assembly code initializes the stack pointer, sets all pins of Port A as outputs, and then loads data into the X register from a predefined data section. It iterates over the data stored in memory, outputting each value to Port A and calling a delay function `myfunc` between each output. The `myfunc` function contains a simple delay loop.

## File Structure

- **DataOutput.asm**: The main assembly file containing the code for outputting data to Port A.
- **README.md**: This readme file providing an overview of the repository.

## Usage

To use this code:
1. Load it onto an AVR microcontroller.
2. Ensure proper connections to Port A for data output.
3. Compile and upload the code using an appropriate toolchain.
